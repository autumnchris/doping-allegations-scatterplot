# Doping Allegations Scatterplot

A D3.js scatterplot built in React.js that presents the top 35 fastest completions of the Alpe d'Huez and whether or not the associated cyclist has been accused of doping during that period.

Inspired by the [Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph) as part of the curriculum for the [Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
