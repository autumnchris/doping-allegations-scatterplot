# Doping Allegations Scatterplot

A D3.js scatterplot that presents the top 35 fastest completions of the Alpe d'Huez and whether or not the associated cyclist has been accused of doping during that period.

Inspired by the [Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph) as part of the curriculum for the [Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
